### Project Description
In this project, a Music streaming startup wants to predict their customer/user churn rate (customers cancelling registered and paid subscriptions). I used Python and Spark for Big Data on the IBM Cloud to perform this analysis. All Notebooks, Clusters, PySpark Sessions and model training were on IBM Watson Studio.

### Cloud Account Setup and Installation
I chose IBM cloud for this project to learn how to work with IBM Watson Studio. I found the Jupyter Notebook very easy to use. To use the IBM Cloud for this project, you need to first create an IBM Watson account and choose the free Lite version which requires no credit card details. This version was enough to get me results for this project even though I blew up my AWS free tier EC2 instance package prior to switching to IBM cloud.
Find more details by visiting the [IBM Cloud Lite version](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-accounts#lite-account-features).
