# Introduction
I have been working on Kaggle for over a year now and I have been curious to know more about Canadians who use Kaggle. 

From the Kaggle Data Science and Machine Learning 2019 survey, I answered several questions about Data Scientists in Canada. The questions raised and the answers are fully described in the .ipnb notebook in this repository.
